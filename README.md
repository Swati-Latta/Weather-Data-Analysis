## Alfido Tech Internship Task - 1

### Introduction: Data Analysis of Weather Data
Weather data is a valuable source of information, providing insights into the dynamic and complex nature of our atmosphere. In this analysis, we delve into a comprehensive dataset capturing various meteorological parameters over a period of time. The dataset includes measurements such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, offering a rich source of information for understanding weather patterns.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the weather data. By employing statistical and visual analysis techniques, we aim to extract meaningful insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the atmospheric conditions during the observed period.


### Key Components of the Analysis:
Temporal Analysis: We initiate our exploration by examining the temporal aspects of the dataset. This includes understanding the variations in temperature, humidity, and other variables across different months, days, and hours. Through time-based visualizations, we aim to identify seasonal patterns and trends.

Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices provide a powerful tool for uncovering relationships between different meteorological parameters. By assessing the correlations between variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, we gain insights into how these factors interact and influence each other.

Wind Speed Distribution: Wind speed is a critical component of weather analysis. We investigate the distribution of wind speeds to identify prevailing conditions. Histograms and line plots are employed to visualize the frequency and trends of wind speeds over the observed period.

Weather Condition Categorization: Categorizing weather conditions allows us to explore the prevalence of different atmospheric states, such as clear skies, snow, or fog. This analysis aids in understanding the frequency and duration of specific weather phenomena.
